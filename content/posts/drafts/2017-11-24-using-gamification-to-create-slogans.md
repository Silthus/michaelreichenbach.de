When looking for a good tagline or slogan you should always try to put some of the 8 Core Drives into it. Don&#8217;t know what I am talking about? Check out [The Ocatlysis Framework][1] by Yu-kai Chou to learn more about his great gamification framework.

<h1 style="text-align: center;">
  What makes a good slogan?
</h1>

Since I learned about gamification, especially the octalysis framework, I cannot stop thinking about how to improve everything related to my [HöhenSucht project][2]. So it was clear to me, to also think about our slogan as a gamified part of the project. What I came up with is:

<div id="attachment_54" style="width: 861px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="https://www.hoehensucht.de"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-54" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/michaelreichenbach.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/entdecke-die-gipfel-der-welt.jpg?resize=750%2C278&#038;ssl=1" alt="Picture about the slogan of HöhenSucht" width="750" height="278" class="wp-image-54 size-full" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/michaelreichenbach.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/entdecke-die-gipfel-der-welt.jpg?w=851&ssl=1 851w, https://i0.wp.com/michaelreichenbach.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/entdecke-die-gipfel-der-welt.jpg?resize=300%2C111&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/michaelreichenbach.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/entdecke-die-gipfel-der-welt.jpg?resize=768%2C284&ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p> 
  
  <p id="caption-attachment-54" class="wp-caption-text">
    EN: Discover the summits of the world
  </p>
</div>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">
  But why is this a good tagline?
</h1>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">
  it <strong>involves</strong> the user <strong>emotionally</strong>
</h2>

It directly calls out to the user and wants him to take a desired action. In this case a really epic action: &#8220;discover the summits of the world&#8221;. This is very catchy and should almost always light up a little explorer spark in the user. Also if the user already hiked to a summit, which is very likely, he will get that epic picture of him standing on top of the summit and therefore is emotionally involved.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">
  it plays into the <strong>story of the product</strong>
</h2>

The tagline should play an essential role in the narrative of your product. If you dont have a story or narrative behind your product, you definitly should try to get some part that builds up a story. By creating a story around your product you can create an epic meaning which fuels into [Core Drive 1: Epic Meaning and Calling][3].

<h2 style="text-align: center;">
  it <strong>call</strong>s <strong>to</strong> an <strong>action</strong>
</h2>

If you directly build in a call-to-action in your slogan, you can reach out to your users and gently push them towards taking a desired action before they even start using your product.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">
  it makes users <strong>curious</strong>
</h2>

By making users curious you are using the black hat [Core Drive 7: Unpredictability & Curiosity][4] which is a great way to make a desired action more urgent. In this case discovering the summits of the world and logging them in the tourbook.

So what about your taglines? Do they tie into the [8 Core Drives][1] to motivate your users towards your desired actions?
