**I want to build an app.**  
And I am going to [build it in public][build-in-public] documenting my thoughts, ideas, failures, and successes here on this blog.

## What to build?

The question seems simple, right? But the moment you think you have an answer, the question comes up again and again: **what to build?**

I have the idea of building **an app for climbers**. The future of the climber's guidebook. One that helps in protecting the ecosystem of climbing, to raise awareness of the environment in the climbing community.

Ok, but **what to build first**? By asking "what to build?", I inevitably have to ask "what to build first?". And that is a tricky one to ask...

Finding out what your potential customers want before building the thing is half of the battle. And not doing it, may come at the price of building the wrong thing.

So I did some research and found out that [UX-Designers][what-is-ux-design] have a very good strategy and method for doing research before building the actual thing: [**User Interviews**][user-interviews]

- working two hours each day
- setting the right goal
- about the idea of a climbing app
- trying to do it the tdd style
- documenting in public
